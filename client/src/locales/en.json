      "title": "My Story",
      "text": "My name is Christine Schwarz. I used to work in hotel management – a demanding job filled with speed, pressure, and responsibility. But the longer I stayed in that field, the more my body began to slow me down. I was constantly exhausted, had trouble concentrating, and migraines with aura and neurological symptoms became part of my daily life. Seasonal allergies made things even worse.\n\nThen – my son was born. It was a beautiful time, and I breastfed him lovingly for a long period. But at the same time, my health continued to decline – until I received the diagnosis: Hashimoto’s."
    },
    "section2": {
      "title": "My Turning Point",
      "text": "I had reached a turning point. Instead of resigning to my fate, I chose to take responsibility – for myself, for my health, for my life. I went back to study and became a certified health educator with a focus on pH balance, gut health, cellular nutrition, micronutrient support, and stress & burnout prevention. I wanted to understand what my body truly needed – and how I could restore what it was lacking.\n\nThe journey wasn’t easy. But it was the right one. Within six months, everything began to change: I regained energy, slept deeply and restfully, and my metabolism improved. Even my appearance transformed – with the right care, my chronically dry skin that had troubled me for years disappeared.\n\nToday, I know: being healthy is my strategy. Health is a choice. Nourished. Radiant. Impactful.\n\nThat’s exactly why I now share my knowledge and experience – because I believe everyone deserves to feel powerful, clear, and vibrant. A holistic approach was my key to transformation – and it can be yours too."
